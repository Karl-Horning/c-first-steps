## 🤓 Introduction

A small collection of beginner C programs I wrote around 2016 as part of my early programming journey.  
These were created while working through [CS50 on edX](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) and are mostly untouched since then. The code is simple, a bit rough, and mostly here for nostalgia and archival purposes.

## 📁 Project structure

```text

src/
├── buggy/
│   └── buggy0.c        # A simple loop with a minor logic bug
├── hello/
│   └── hello.c         # The classic "Hello, world" program
├── mario/
│   └── mario.c         # A basic pyramid visualisation with input handling
├── scores/
│   ├── scores.c        # Calculates average of three hardcoded scores
│   └── scores1.c       # Uses an array and a function to calculate average

```

## 🧠 Notes

- These were my first attempts at programming in C.
- They use only standard libraries (for example, `stdio.h`).
- The `mario.c` program prompts the user for a height between 1–8 and prints a double-pyramid.
- `scores1.c` is an early introduction to functions and arrays.

## 🕰️ Why this exists

I never went further with C, but I'm keeping these files here as a small time capsule of my learning process. They’re not meant to be perfect or idiomatic—just a record of where I started.
